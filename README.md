# Study-ReactNative
This looks very promising, so let's start some study with depth and breadth to test it's strengths and limitations.


## Getting Started

Well!  Apparently there's nothing like jumping right in.  Expo will certainly ignite a spark and set off a firestorm of enthusiastic study of React Native.  Combined with Snack to effortlessly share and publish training activity over the web.  Simply Amazing!

## IDEs and Editors

### Webstorm

Very cool debugging, very easy to enable.  Pretty lightweight RN project template, lighter than Ignite.

Webstorm hides some files in the /var/private..tmp are.  Not sure how these are maintained yet.  Nice that it is aware that you can have a ton of files getting in the way and accomodate that both visually and on the file system.

## Handy References

Besides the obvious https://facebook.github.io/react-native/

### Good default gitignore file

<https://github.com/gabergg/ReactNativeTodoList/blob/master/.gitignore>



## What Does a React-Native Stack Look Like ?

The first thing I needed, after a trello board to keep organized, was a diagram.  If I'm really going to pick this up, it will mean I'm inevitably going to be training others as well.  For me, a mental map is developed and maintained 100 times more efficiently with diagrams.

## How Does It Work ?

## Development Environment Selection

### Webstorm

### Atom/Nuclide

### Deco


# Branches

bootstrap - Get this repo going, layout the study plan via an Outline in the Readme and build momentum

# Key Terminal Commands

## Prepare React Framework

### Expo

	npm install -g create-react-native-app
	
### Otherwise

	npm install -g react-native-cli
	
### Ignite

	npm install -g ignite-cli

### Webstorm 

From Webstorm RN Tutorial here: https://blog.jetbrains.com/webstorm/2016/12/developing-mobile-apps-with-react-native-in-webstorm/

Webstorm wants this package installed to create a new project:

	npm install -g create-react-app
