### 0.0.1

Beginnings of a learning spree.  Expo based fun factor started.  Editing with Nuclide and building up tutorial based experience.

### 0.0.2 Hello World

Build App.js from scratch with minimal referencing, understanding dependencies along the way.  Bare minimum code by current understanding.  StyleSheet so far = watch out tons of non-intuitive memorization ahead (flex must know vertical starting from top by default, justified means something in this direction too, align doesn't).

### 0.0.3 Jest

Use RSpec style testing immediately in an Expo environment.  Snapshots give you a normalized and repeatable structural representation of the view hierarchy.  Mind blown !

Other than Webstorm, debugger configuration seems a bit of a mystery yet, not out of the box or I'm missing something thus far.  If I need a browser to drive tests that don't require it, then why not use an IDE ?  Sticking with Webstorm for now.
